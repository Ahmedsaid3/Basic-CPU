# Basic CPU 
This project demonstrates a design and simulation of a hardwired control unit for a computer organization using Verilog HDL in Vivado environment. By systematically following the provided instructions, we were able to create an efficient and reliable basic computer.
Through simulation testing, we validated the functionality of our control unit design and ensured that it meets the specified requirements.
Overall, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in digital circuit design and computer organization principles, enhancing our understanding of hardware implementation in computer systems.
